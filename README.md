Hey Ronny, I think I can just type normally here. This is your first step in a long journey to try to continually challenge yourself and a lifelong desire to experience more.

This will be challenging, but always keep in mind that you aren't a lone little fish swimming in a big sea and that there are like minded people who would see you helped. Keep an open mind as you develop these skills.

Good luck!
